# Role-Analysis
This is a sanitised version of an algorithm that calculates and defines the relationship between agents and clients.
Developed in Teradata environment.

The final table output show the different types of role counts:
1. Both Role Count - where the agent is responsible for both roles
2. Different Role Count - where the client has different agents for the roles
3. One Role Count - where the client only has one agent for one role
4. No Role Count - where the client does not have an agent for either role
